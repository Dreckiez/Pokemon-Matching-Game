# Pokemon Matching Game :shipit:
This is a mini project for my **Programming Techniques** subject. The projectâ€™s purpose was to test my understandings and knowledge about **2D pointer** and **Linked List** as well as my programming skills.

This project was created based on the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library. I chose it because it seems like a modern and easy-to-use library for videogames programming with many handy functions for visualization.
>"raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools or editors... just coding in pure spartan-programmers way."
